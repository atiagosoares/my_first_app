## Description</h3>

        Who Am I? is a game in which the players need to ask yes or no questions to figure out
        what character they are. This is a really fun party game that can be played with at least
        two people, but it is the most fun with 6 to 12 people.

## Rules

        When the game starts, you'll assign a character to another player. Likewise, some other player
        will assign a character to you. This character could be a famous person, a fictional character,
        a historical figure or even an object. It's really up to you and you friends to decide what's
        valid.
        You can't see which character you are, but you can see who everyone else is.<br>
        The game is played in turns. In your turn, you can ask one "yes" or "no" question about who
        you are. This question could be "Am I a real character?" or "Do I have super powers?". Your friends,
        that can see whou you are, have to answer the question.
        The goal is to guess which character you are
      
## About this app
        
        This implementation of Who Am I? is meant to be played either in person or remotely via something
        like Discord.
        This app will handle the aspects of assigning characters, keeping control of
        which character everyone is and receiving guesses. Basically just enough to replace pen and paper.<br>
        This app does not deal with the aspects of controlling turns, making questions or aswering question.
        Those should be done outside the app.
