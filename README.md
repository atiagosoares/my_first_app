# OBJECTIVE

In this project I'll build a simple project for a web application.

I'm interested in data science, and my bigger goal is to eventually build data based application.
Altough I'm already pretty comfortable with the the steps related to extracting data from apis, cleaning
the data, storing the data on SQL databases, building models and visualizations, I'm know very
little about setting up servers to host a database and application. 

I also know very little about front end development.

The goal of this project is getting more comfortable with ways to build and deploy and end-to-end
application, setting up servers, services, etc...
